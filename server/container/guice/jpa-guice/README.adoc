= Guice-JPA Server How-to

This server target single node James deployments. By default, the derby database is used.

== Requirements

 * Java 11 SDK

== Running

To run james, you have to create a directory containing required configuration files.

James requires the configuration to be in a subfolder of working directory that is called
**conf**. A [sample directory](https://github.com/apache/james-project/tree/master/server/container/guice/jpa-guice/sample-configuration)
is provided with some default values you may need to replace. You will need to update its content to match your needs.

You also need to generate a keystore with the following command:

[source]
----
$ keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -keystore conf/keystore
----

Once everything is set up, you just have to run the jar with:

[source]
----
$ java -javaagent:james-server-jpa-guice.lib/openjpa-3.1.2.jar -Dworking.directory=. -Dlogback.configurationFile=conf/logback.xml -jar james-server-jpa-guice.jar
----

Note that binding ports below 1024 requires administrative rights.
